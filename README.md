Odin Recipes Project
Introduction
The Odin Recipes project is a beginner-friendly HTML practice task designed to build a basic recipe website. The site consists of an index page linking to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page contains a description, an image, an ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions. The project emphasizes foundational HTML structure and will later incorporate CSS for styling.

Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I practiced key HTML skills, including creating semantic structure, linking pages, and organizing content into headings, lists, and images. This project also integrates version control practices using Git and GitHub for efficient project management and collaboration.
