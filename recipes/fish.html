    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        
        To prepare fish wet fry, start by cleaning 2–3 whole fish or fillets thoroughly and pat them</br>
        dry. Season the fish with salt, black pepper, and optional spices like paprika or turmeric.</br>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and fry the fish until golden brown on both sides,</br>
        then set aside. In the same skillet, sauté chopped onions, garlic, and ginger until fragrant.</br>
        Add diced tomatoes and cook until they form a thick sauce. Optional ingredients like</br>
        diced bell peppers, chili, or fresh coriander can be added for extra flavor

    </p>
    <p>
        
        Return the fried fish to the skillet and gently coat it with the sauce, simmering for 5–10</br>
        minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</br>
        Serve hot with ugali, rice, or your favorite side dish. Enjoy the rich, savory flavors of this,</br>
        quick and satisfying dish!
